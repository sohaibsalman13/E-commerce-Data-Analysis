# E-commerce Data Analysis with BigQuery & Looker

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce raw data at the order level and performing various data analyses to calculate revenue per SKU, compare it against target revenues, and visualize key metrics via dashboards.

The key objectives are:

1. Data Import and Calculation: Import raw Shopify data into Google BigQuery and calculate daily revenue per SKU for a specific period.
2. Revenue Target Comparison: Define target revenues for each SKU and compare these targets against actual revenues.
3. Visualization: Create a visual dashboard using Looker Studio to track actual revenues versus targets, as well as highlight underperforming SKUs.
